This repository contains codes for my R&D Project on Image Reconstruction from Poisson Corrupted Sparse Tomographic Projections

Important files:

R&D_Presentation.pdf: Pdf version of my final presentation. Read this to get an overview of the project

reconstruct_joint.m: Implementation of the proposed approach of jointly reconstructing similar images from Poisson corrupted CT projections. Run to view results.

reconstruct_framewise.m: Implementation of the same approach applied to each image individually. Run to view results
